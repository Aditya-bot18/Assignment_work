                    <h3>Cha Yeon-woo</h3>
                    <p>If you have read the Second Life Ranker, you know that this dude is overpowered beyond belief. I
                        think it is still my favorite read overall, although I will admit I am attracted to the “main
                        character easily overcoming obstacles with style” trope. Yeon-woo has boundless capabilities
                        with the powers of the Black King, a being similar to Azathoth from the Lovecraft stories.</p>

                    <h3>Yang Kai</h3>

                    <p>I have to get these cultivation manhwas out of the way because I haven’t read the Martial Peak
                        novel, but undoubtedly all of these characters are among the strongest characters. Their
                        positions in strength are debatable, and I’d say Magic Emperor’s Zhou Fan could also be in this
                        category. Anyways, they all reach far past the universal power realm, and a lot of these
                        characters have powers like/on par with reality manipulation.

                        <h3> Kim Dokja</h3>

                        <p>On top of being one of the strongest, he’s also one of the best in my opinion. Dokja was
                            always smart and his knowledge of the story helped him advance through a lot, becoming the
                            Demon King and finally the Ancient Dream Constellation, where he was omniscient and could
                            manipulate reality. Enough to put him above the rest on this list

                            <h3>Phantaminum</h3>

                            <p>A feat-less being shrouded in mystery and above the likes of Zahard and Enryu from Tower
                                of God, I think he could be the true god of the tower. As an Axis, he is basically
                                hinted to have control over a story from the Talze User verse; he has reality
                                manipulation. I think this means he is a weaker version of “The Writer” from DC. I can’t
                                think of many other characters that have this ability on top of strong shinsoo
                                manipulation and so on.

                                <h3> Harem King</h3>

                                <p>
                                    This character isn’t exactly feat-less as he’s described as a transcendent that
                                    overpowers the rest of the Ninth Gate from The Gamer. There are many theories that
                                    he’s Han Ji-Han (the main character) from the future, Ji-Han’s son, etc, but
                                    considering Ji-Han’s overpowered creation and destruction abilities and his
                                    nigh-immortality and how he is still only in the top 10 in the verse, the top dog in
                                    the verse definitely belongs in this spot on the list. If I wasn’t taking one
                                    character from each manhwa, Han Ji-Han would probably be on the list as well.

                                    <p>
                                        Before I get into anything here, I want to say Jin Mori could also take fifth
                                        place, but I just want to think the Harem King is stronger. Anyways, this dude
                                        is the Goku of webtoons, and he overcame numerous obstacles in God of
                                        Highschool. Defeating an ascended Supreme God Park Mujin is no small feat, and
                                        he became a True God after reaching Nirvana.

                                        <h3>Lukas Trowman</h3>

                                        <p>Lukas Trowman’s archenemy in the manhwa so far has been Lord, the strongest
                                            demigod who already wields spatial powers on a universal level at the least.
                                            After having defeated Lord in the novel, he absorbs three universes and is
                                            too strong for his universe to handle. I think he deserves a spot on this
                                            list for his divine power feats.
